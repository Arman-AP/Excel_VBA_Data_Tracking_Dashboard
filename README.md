First function of this application is to calculate the BMI of the user using their provided weight and height. 

Both metric and imperial units are accepted. The BMI is generated, and the corresponding category is displayed. 

A colorize BMI Table is also generated and contains values regarding different categories of a healthy BMI. 

This page will also display the users BMI to help understand where they belong in terms of a healthy lifestyle. 

The second part of the application creates a user pool, each identified by their first, last name and an auto generated ID. 

Similarly, there exists a weight pool where each data entered into the system and the date entered are linked to a user ID. 

This allows for analysis of the user data to create charts and export them to a Word document. 

Users can add records of their weight and there can be multiple members with assigned weight records.

The manual provided with this project explains and walks through the steps of taking a full advantage of this project.
